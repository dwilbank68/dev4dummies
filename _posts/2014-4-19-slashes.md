for new students who have trouble remembering whether to use forward `/` or back `\` slashes…

You could think of them as uphill and downhill slopes -- if you read and write in english, anyway.

Win-dow-s - downhill slash

U-nix (Mac) - uphill slash

and the same trick will works for URLs… which begin with 'U', so they go uphill.
